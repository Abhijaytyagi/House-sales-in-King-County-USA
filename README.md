# House-sales-in-King-County-USA

INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND:
Worldwide economies rely heavily on the property market, which affects both the financial security of an individual and the stability of the economy as a whole. Comprehending the variables that influence housing costs is crucial for several stakeholders, such as homeowners, purchasers, vendors, legislators, and scholars. In this project, we create a regression model to find the factors that influence house values, delving into the intricate dynamics of the housing industry.

PREVIOUS WORK: Numerous research have used a variety of approaches and datasets to investigate the factors that influence property prices. Previous research has highlighted square footage, geographic qualities (e.g., proximity to amenities, school districts), property quality, and economic indicators (e.g., interest rates, employment rates) as important drivers of house prices. These studies provide useful insights into the issues that influence housing valuation and serve as the basis for our study. Building on previous research, we hope to provide further insights customized to the specific setting of King County, Washington, USA. Links for the referred research papers is at the end of this report.

DATA USED: This dataset includes house sale prices from King County, which includes Seattle. It covers properties sold between May 2014 and May 2015. Data source: https://data.kingcounty.gov/; also available on kaggle.com.The dataset has 21 attributes and 21613 observations. It represents a set of observational data that documents actual property sales in the region. The data collecting process was carried out by government third-party institutions in charge of documenting real estate transactions. This data may be collected for purposes such as keeping public records, assessing property taxes, and monitoring housing market changes.

QUESTIONS OF INTEREST: The primary focus of the study is to analyze the relationship between house prices and square footage of living space. Specifically, we want to know whether living area size has a substantial impact on property prices in King County, Washington, USA. In addition, we look for additional characteristics, such as property grade, age, view, waterfront status, and condition, that may influence house price variations. By answering these questions, we hope to provide useful insights into the factors that influence house prices.

Hypothesis Question: Does the size of the living area affect property prices?

Ho: There is no correlation between living space size and home price.

Ha: Larger living space sizes often raise housing prices.

Dependent Variable: House price

Independent Variable: Variable of interest: sqrt_lving - square feet of living space Control variables: sqrt_lot, floors, # of bedrooms, # of bathrooms, waterfront&views
